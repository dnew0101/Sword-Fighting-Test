This project is simply me tinkering around with Roblox Studio/Lua to demo the language, and get a true feel for the game development process! I plan to make a fairly simple game in visual design, but complex in the gaming dynamics/playability. This will include a fairly extensive combat/defense system on the frontend and a match-making server on the backend!

SIDE NOTES:
-
Given the current state of the software development job market, I figured I'd try a more unconventional approach to learning, which emphasizes creativity over structured learning. While it is a fairly desperate time, I do feel as though this is a great opportunity to exemplify my skills in other departments outside of web development, and a fantastic opportunity to garner experience with Lua, a very lightweight and powerful programming language!

Hopefully this game (which will be released on Roblox in due time), will be an enjoyable and rewarding experience! I'm excited to see where this opportunity leads me! :)
